## 🚀 How to Use

### Apply Migration
```bash
# Using MySQL command line
mysql -u root collabora_files < database/migrations_part2.sql

# Or on Windows
apply_migration.bat
```

### Verify Installation
```bash
# Run verification script
php verify_migration_part2.php
```

### Test Queries
```sql
-- Get upcoming events
CALL sp_get_upcoming_events(1, 1, 7);

-- Get task statistics
CALL sp_get_task_statistics(1, 1);

-- View active events
SELECT * FROM v_active_events;

-- View active tasks
SELECT * FROM v_active_tasks;
```
